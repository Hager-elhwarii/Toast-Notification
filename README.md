# Toast-Notification :bulb: 
- Create A Toast Notification in HTML CSS &amp; JavaScript | Toast Notification in JavaScript.

- Users can click on the particular button like "success," "error," or "info," and the relevant toast notification will show in the top right corner. 

- This toast will be removed automatically after 5 seconds, or users can also hide it by clicking on the close icon. To make the toast more attractive, I've also added a progress line on the bottom of each toast.
