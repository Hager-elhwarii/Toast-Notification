# Toast Notification :bulb: 
- Create A Toast Notification in HTML, CSS, and `JavaScript`.

- Users can click on the particular button like `success`, `error`, `warning`, or `info`, and the relevant toast notification will show in the top right corner. 

- Each toast will be removed automatically after 5 seconds, or users can also hide it by clicking on the close icon. To make the toast more attractive, I've also added a progress line on the bottom of each toast.
